Brukt følgende prompt for å generere innhold med Claude Code: 

Populate the source/episodes folder with the content that I want. This is an AI introduction course for administrativ staffat the University of Oslo. The course is in Norwegian. It should be a course that the participants go through digitally by themselves, and should take no more than 45 minutes. The topics I want to cover are: 

1. What is AI and what is generative AI - what are language models
2. LLMs are not a knowledge source, but construct contents/sentences based on what is statistically most probable with some added randomness
3. Can you trust what comes out of generative AI? Quality control, understand the contents
4. What AI services do we have at UiO https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/ki/
5. Try prompting and simple prompt engineering
6. Other things you think are essential in an intro course in AI tools for administrative staff at UiO.
